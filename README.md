# hmrc-practical-test
A short practical test

## Overview
The requirements are specified in document:
/docs/Front End Developer.docx

To run it, simply open up src/index.html

## Delivery
I did lift the core scaffolding for the SASS library from my own working boilerplate, so there was additional time spent on getting set up however I stuck to an hour for the actual build.

## Future Improvements
This test was time-boxed, here are some improvements that could be undertaken:

### Layout
* Tighten up margins/ paddings/ fonts (HMRC font is licensed so used Arial)
* Provide overlays/ tooltips for 'help' prompts
* Use responsive background images where needed (logos)
* Demo some fallbacks for IE < 9 where I've used some HTML5/ CSS3 which would need filling in, perhaps using Modernizer

### Functionality
* Provide some example form submission/ validation feebdack

### Build
* Template the build using pre-compilation
* Add minification
